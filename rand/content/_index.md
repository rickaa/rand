Hello there! I'm Ricardo, currently a medicine student student at [Universitat de Barcelona](http://www.ub.edu/medicina/es/) also working on machine learning and software engineering projects.

I'm especially interested in working towards integrating new tools into the healthcare ecosystem that can accelerate accurate diagnosis and improve the patient's experience. You can see my projects in my [Github profile](github.com/polyrand), read my [blog](ricardoanderegg.com/posts/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/ricardoanderegg).
